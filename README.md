# The-Attack
............................................................................................................

This is our final project for web-game development course COMP-397.
This project is basic game developing using typescript and convert it into javascript in visual studio code. 
This project is using keyboard to move the space ship.
Our game is a top down shooter.

............................................................................................................
In the game an alien invasion is taking place and the player has to stop them with their jet
After lasting a certain amount of time on a level the player would proceed to the next level.

............................................................................................................
Our game is a top down shooter that is inspired from the game that gives sense of fun and thrill to the player. Therefore, we come with the idea of game “The Attack”.
We have added the enemies ,ships, ,health and score to makes the player get addict to this game.
Health and score and is not working properly and We are left with it.
But the score and health functionality is still under progress......
